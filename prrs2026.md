title: 14th IAPR Workshop on Pattern Recognition in Remote Sensing 
---

In conjunction with 28th [International Conference On Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2026)](https://icpr2026.org/). Please register on the ICPR website to participate.

# Important Dates

* **August, 17-21, 2026** - International Conference On Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2026) in Lyon, France.

# Aims and scope
As one of the flagship events of the International Association for Pattern Recognition, Pattern Recognition in Remote Sensing Workshop brings together researchers from both pattern recognition and remote sensing, with emphasis on the application of pattern recognition methods to remotely sensed data. The steady progress in the development of new remote sensing devices and remote sensing technology has led to ever-increasing data and new challenges. Thus, a need arises to apply the latest methods of machine learning and pattern recognition for automated analysis of this kind of data. This workshop will provide an ideal forum for spreading and exchanging the latest experiences of international researchers. 

# Topics
With the increase of availability of images and the importance of climate change, the Earth Observation and Remote Sensing fields have seen a growing interest. For instance, 50% of the EO satellites have been launched in the last 5 years. With this growing number of available data, a bottleneck in data representation and interpretation appeared. Many tasks of pattern recognition are therefore relevant to interpret remotely sensed data. During this day, we aim at covering the following topics:    
* Deep learning for Earth observation data
* Foundation models for Earth observation data
* Vision and language models for Earth observation
* Semantic classification and parameter estimation from remote sensing data
* Active, interactive and transfer learning
* Multi-modal and multi-temporal analysis
* Extraction, selection, learning, and reduction of features
* Novel pattern recognition tasks in remote sensing applications
* Explainable and interpretable machine learning
* Hybrid models, combining physics and machine learning
* Benchmark models and datasets
