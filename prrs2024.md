title: 13th IAPR Workshop on Pattern Recognition in Remote Sensing 
---

In conjunction with 27th [International Conference On Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2024)](https://icpr2024.org/). Please register on the ICPR website to participate.

# Important Dates

* **December 1-4, 2024** International Conference On Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2024)
* ~~**August 12, 2024**~~ **August 22, 2024** (Updated) - Workshop paper submission deadline
* **September 13, 2024** - Notification to authors
* **September 24, 2024** - Camera ready deadline

# Aims and scope
As one of the flagship events of the International Association for Pattern Recognition, Pattern Recognition in Remote Sensing Workshop brings together researchers from both pattern recognition and remote sensing, with emphasis on the application of pattern recognition methods to remotely sensed data. The steady progress in the development of new remote sensing devices and remote sensing technology has led to ever-increasing data and new challenges. Thus, a need arises to apply the latest methods of machine learning and pattern recognition for automated analysis of this kind of data. This workshop will provide an ideal forum for spreading and exchanging the latest experiences of international researchers. 

# Topics
Researchers are welcome to submit papers in the following areas or related topics: 

* Semantic classification and parameter estimation from hyperspectral and multispectral images
* Extraction, selection, learning, and reduction of features
* Deep learning for Earth observation data
* Clustering
* Active and transfer learning
* Multi-modal and multi-temporal analysis
* Image analysis of SAR and airborne thermal data
* Recognition of man-made objects from aerial and space platforms
* Novel pattern recognition tasks in remote sensing applications 
* Explainable and interpretable machine learning
* Hybrid models (physics+machine learning)
* Benchmark datasets

# Submission guidelines

We follow the same submission instructions as the ICPR conference (single-blind review process). Please carefully read the [instructions](https://icpr2024.org/Instruction.html) before submission. 

Please follow the Springer LNCS format with maximum 15 pages (including references) for paper submission. To take care of reviewers' comments, one more page is allowed (without any charge) during revised/camera ready submission. Moreover, authors may purchase up to 2 extra pages. Extra page charges must be paid at the time of registration.

Springer LNCS paper formatting instructions and templates for ICPR-2024 are available here [DOC](https://icpr2024.org/pdf/ICPR_2024_DOC_Templates.zip) and [Latex](https://icpr2024.org/pdf/ICPR_2024_LaTeX_Templates.zip). For Supplementary materials, follow the above-mentioned instructions.

All papers should be submitted via CMT: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PRRS2024](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PRRS2024) . 

All accepted and presented papers in PRRS 2024 will be published in the ICPR 2024 Workshop proceedings as per ICPR guidelines.
